        <li class="flow"><img src="Images/Project1/flowchart.png" class="inline-photo show-on-scroll"><h3 class="week1">Week 1 - 3</h3><p>During the first few weeks from the start of the first semester we got to meet and get to know our peers and other students. The first week started off with an introduction of the programming language Python, which would later on be used for the implementation for our projects in the future. The first project which is a modified version of the Hangman Game. The task was to create a more friendly version of the Hangman Game, I choose to go with a guessing game where the player would see a combination of pictures to analyze the name or words included in the picture to then merge the words together to guess the word hence the title of the game “The Guess The Word Game”. </p></li>
        <li class="w1"><p>The process of this project was, firstly creating a flowchart of the guessing game. Which is then used to create a wireframe of the game to get an image off how it is supposed to look like. In the second week we were introduced more about list, loops, strings and HTML files, with that we made the manual page for the web application app for the Guess The Word game. After completing the HTML of the manual page, we had to do some web hosting using FileZilla where I encountered a few errors along the way but eventually succeeded to host the page and submit the assignment. The third week was a calmer week where we had a few group discussions where we had to create a magazine cover for a company of our choice and assign each group member with their rolls in this company. The company we decided to use was a delivery company which we called “SF Delivery” with the slogan “Fast to the door, bad to the core” which is supposed to represent the estimated time of the delivery where it is supposedly to be an extra fast delivery.</p> <img src="Images/Project1/wireframe 1.jpg" class="inline-photo show-on-scroll"></li>

        <h2 class="2nd">2. Greenhouse Project</h2>
        <li class="flow2"><h3 class="week2">Week 4 - 6</h3><p>Second project (authentic task) that was introduced to us was the “Greenhouse Project”. Groups of two were made to complete a few tasks. Understanding what the whole project was about and analyzing the problems that was preventing the greenhouse to improve then coming up with a solution to help improve and update the “Greenhouse” technology. Creating a flowchart of the solution that we created using the user requirements of the interviews that were provided, with that we created the proposal and the personas for the greenhouse. With all information gathered we created the dashboard and implemented all the requirements using a micro web framework written in Phyton which is called Flask.</p><img src="Images/Project2/ghFlow.png" class="inline-photo show-on-scroll"></li>

We started of by creating a plan of the whole system, with that we created a progress diagram which is used to get a better vision on how we want the solution to work. Having created a project plan we started straight away with interviewing our fellow peers which were supposed to be the clients for the pizza project to get a better understanding of the “Owner/Chef” and the “Cashier” of the company wants and needs for their new ordering system. With all the information gathered we then started with the implementation of the ordering system to create the final product. We divided our tasks with creating the servers I created the HTML and CSS from the first interface with the pizza picture visible but turns out that it was too complicated to use given there was not enough time to finish the project with that interface. We changed the whole layout of the interface and went with something much simpler. Finishing everything we presented our project where we had to divide the slides into two due to one of our group members not participating in the presentation.</p></li>

        <h2 class="s1">Sprint 1</h2>
        <li class="sp1"><p>In this sprint we got to know each other in our new class in the profile phase (advance phase) and assigned to our groups during the first few days of the first week we had to make a decision of a website that we are supposed to make. After being stuck on deciding whether to go with the tutorial website or the student housing website we decided to go with the student housing website because we felt like it would fit us the most and it also motivated us the most due to us being students ourself and having experienced the difficulties of finding a place to stay here in Eindhoven. We proceeded to do the field study by creating a survey and conducting three interviews with fellow students, which resulted in the survey having approximately 84.2% of the student that are studying here in Eindhoven find it hard to find a housing. After analyzing the data that we received we created two personas based on the field study results.  </p></li><br>


 <h2 class="s2">Sprint 2</h2>
 <li class="sp2"><img src="Images/Advanced/Wireframe.jpeg"   class="inline-photo show-on-scroll"><p>In this sprint we started brainstorming on how we wanted the whole website to look and work from the inside out. We started by pitching ideas from each group members and finally decided to start working on the low fidelity wireframe which was taking pictures of the sketches that we have drawn on the whiteboard, which we then converted to a mid-fidelity wireframe with add on titles and descriptions. The final prototype we created using Adobe XD, with this we made the flowchart of the user interactions and core functionalities where we all included in the design document explaining how we implemented our user requirements into the design</p></li>

<h2 class="s3">Sprint 3</h2>
<li class="sp3"><p>Testing our design to see if we discover any problems so that we can find the solution for these problems to improve our product. In the user testing document, we tested the final result of our student housing website, before conducting the actual useability test, we asked our participants to sign the consent form making sure we have permission to record the user. We discovered a list of problems and came up with the solutions to improve our prototype and begin with the implementation of the actual website. After completing the useability test, we created a roadmap plan to divide the workload to every group member to begin with the implementation.</p></li>

<h2 class="s4">Sprint 4</h2>
<li class="sp4"><p>Here we started with the implementation of the actual website using HTML, CSS and JS, which then has to be hosted on Hera. By dividing the pages and focusing on the required pages first helped us to finish the website on time. We both completed our task and later on at the end combined both and made it work together with some adjustments. When everything is complete, we made the presentation and presented our final product in front of the whole class. The website question will be link right below: <br> </p></li>
