        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>
          Hi! My name is Ni Nengah Dwi Melita Suriada, you can call me Dwi or
          Mel ♡
        </h3>
        <p>
          Let me tell you a little bit about me, I am a 19 year old student
          currently studying ICT & Media at the Fontys University of Applied
          Science in the Netherlands. Before coming to study here in the
          Netherlands I lived in Bali my whole life, with both of my parents and
          my older brother. <br />
          love to take random walks at night and discover new places. I am also
          an animal lover, which is probably why I have 3 dogs and 2 cats back
          home in Indonesia. If you have any pets and if you ever introduced
          them to me I will probably steal your pets one day and disappear ☻
